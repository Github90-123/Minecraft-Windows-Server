## Installation

First off you need to download the 'server.tar' file so you have to download it from this link : "https://mega.nz/file/yGg2SSaB#EmScv1gqgjNSaIvF5yuzFhD2SMiBOZC56bOyeK2A2Es".

After that move the 'server.tar' to the folder with the files (DO NOT EXTRACT THE 'server.tar' FILE)

Double click on "Minecraft Server (X GB Version) (Compiled).exe", The "X GB" is the version that will be allocated to the servers using java.

It should now bring up a console.

Enjoy!
